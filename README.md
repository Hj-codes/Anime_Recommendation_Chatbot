# Anime Recommendation Chatbot
### AnimeBot: An Anime Recommendation Chatbot
AnimeBot is a Python project that combines web scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup to collect data from Anilist, which serves as our training dataset for an Anime Recommendation System. Additionally, we integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) to create a chatbot that can assist users in discovering their next favorite anime.

## Project Overview
### What is AnimeBot?
AnimeBot is a project that aims to create an intelligent chatbot capable of recommending anime series and movies to users based on their preferences. It leverages web scraping techniques to gather information about various anime titles from Anilist and uses this data to train its recommendation engine.

## How Does It Work?
**Web Scraping**: AnimeBot utilizes Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape detailed information about anime titles, including titles, genres, ratings, and more, from Anilist. This scraped data serves as the foundation for the recommendation system.

**Anime Recommendation System**: We build a recommendation system using machine learning algorithms, possibly collaborative filtering or content-based filtering, to suggest anime titles to users based on their viewing history and preferences.

**Chatbot Integration**: To enhance user interaction, we integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) into the project, enabling AnimeBot to engage in natural language conversations with users. Users can ask for anime recommendations, inquire about specific anime details, and receive personalized suggestions.

**User Feedback Loop**: AnimeBot allows users to provide feedback on the recommendations they receive, helping to continuously improve the system's accuracy and relevance.
